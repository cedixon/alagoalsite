## a la goal!

### what is it?
**a la goal** is a football/soccer game with an emphasis on quick, refined gameplay. I love sports, but sports games are usually either too simple or too complex for my taste. a la goal is my attempt to find a good in-between point!

### philosophy
**a la goal** keeps some of the strategy, tactical depth, and management/simulation features of big sports games, but casual-izes them so they aren’t so technical.

There are only 2 buttons in the match – one to kick the ball, and one to change team tactics. The rest is handled by your players! It’s a fun, engaging mix between passively watching the match like Football Manager and having to position your players, pass, tackle, etc all on your own, like FIFA.
